# Olympics Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Olympics dataset (1896-2016) from Kaggle, focusing on key insights and visualizations created using Power BI. The visualizations provide an overview of the participating countries, sports, medals, and trends over time.

## Problem Solving

In this project, I have tackled the following 8 problems using the Olympics dataset:

1. How many Olympic Games have been held?
2. Mention the total number of countries that participated in the Olympics game so far.
3. Top 5 sports that won the most medals and gender-wise categorization.
4. Find the ratio of male and female athletes who won medals in the Olympics.
5. Trends in the participation of males and females in the Olympics over the years.
6. Fetch the top 10 countries that won the most number of medals.
7. Find the number of medals won as per the seasons.
8. Fetch the top 10 athletes that won the most number of medals.
